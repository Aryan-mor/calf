#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- GitHub may track created links. Links you generate and share via GitHub Pages could be logged or appear in GitHub analytics/traffic data. Also, we use openstreetmap.org for autocomplete and goatcounter.com as visit counter.
- Updates may break older links. I‚Äôll try to maintain backward compatibility, but breaking changes can happen between versions.
- Base of the code is developed with the help of AI. So you would probably see a lot of pollutions and awful code structure!
